# Keenethics test task - admin booking page(client) + server
## Description
The task for this test assignment was to recreate the given design of the admin booking page using *React* and the server using *node.js express* and *mongodb*. In addition, I also used *tailwindcss* for styling, *RTK query* for data fetching, *react hook form* for forms, *zod* for validation. The solution is divided into separate folders(client, server).
